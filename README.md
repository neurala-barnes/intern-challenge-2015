# Neurala - Intern coding challenge 2015


This coding challenge involves testing the parametrization of a
convolution-based image edge finder. For example, given the following image:

![Original image](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs143/results/proj5/valayshah/BSDS/376001.jpg)

The ideal output of an edge detector would be something like the image below.

The code in `main.cpp` gives an example of how to load an image, process the
image with a given set of parameters, and to save the result as a separate
image.

Your job is to:

1. Decide how to measure whether the algorithm is doing a good job of finding
   edges, and write a paragraph on your proposed measurement, its strengths, and
   its weaknesses.

2. Write a program that performs this measurement for a set of parameters that
   you decide to try; and

3. Produce a graph that demonstrates something about how to choose a good set of
   parameters for the test images in the [data/][] directory.

You'll be evaluated on how thoroughly you can think through a nebulous problem
(demonstrated by what you write and plot) as well as the quality of the code you
turn in.


## Other details

Send me (Tim; barnes@neurala.com) a zip/tar file with your results (metric
description, code, and plot) by __Thursday, March 5__ at 6 PM. You'll hear
back from me within 24 hours after that.

You should plan to spend up to eight hours of work on the challenge.

If you get stuck or otherwise have a question, don't hesitate to send up to an
email a day. If you don't receive a reply within 12 hours, your time will be
extended by that amount over the 12 hours.

You may use any number and types of programming languages, external libraries,
or other tools that you like, as long as they're free or I can otherwise access
those tools to evaluate the code after you submit it.

__Good luck!__
